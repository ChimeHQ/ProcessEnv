# ProcessEnv

ProcessEnv is a small library for capturing the shell configuration used by a Foundation/AppKit process. This is very handy for launching `NSTask` instances with the same configuration.

## Integration

Carthage:

You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install this as a static library.

```
github "ChimeHQ/ProcessEnv"
```

Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChimeHQ/ProcessEnv.git")
]
```
